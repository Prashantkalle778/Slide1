There are more than 243 banks in the country with a total balance sheet of CHF 3.3 trillion. The market has a clear focus on serving the needs of Swiss residents, but more than 50^%^ of revenue comes from other countries, mostly from the European Union. As recently as 2011, you needed to have an account in a traditional bank to receive a salary, make payments and obtain a mortgage. But since 2021, digital banking offerings have become plentiful and very diverse in nature.   In this context, three different banking models have emerged. \\n·\\tE-banking apps of traditional banks: These are provided as part of the general banking package, responding to users’ increasing need for practicality in their day-to-day lives.\\n       YDZ, Switzerland’s largest all-purpose bank, has acquired over 2.6 million personal customers, including 30^%^ of Swiss households, although it has not disclosed data on its e-banking and mobile users. HypoSuisse, the number two bank, has grown to 1.5 million clients in Switzerland. Both banks offer e-banking internet services, which has branched out into mobile phone applications. YDZ had a generic app that serves all its personal customers, although it is not strictly speaking a digital bank -  a visit to the branch is required to open an account. Once subscribed, customers can do everything online - access their accounts, make payments, manage their credit card, including checking the balance, transfer money and contact a specialist in a branch for major operations (loans, etc.). The app also includes some basic portfolio management tools and a customizable notifications feature. Most YDZ packages cost between CHF 10 and CHF 20 per month. YDZ has very few add-on and ancillary services besides a regular loyalty program (YDZ KeyClub). HypoSuisse has similar packages, ranging from CHF 15 to CHF 80 per month. \\n\\n·\\tOnline banks (also called neo-banks): Sometimes pure players, sometimes part of legacy banks, this group of enterprises offer a differentiated product and generally have a banking license through partners or owners. Some are Swiss, while others do not possess a banking license yet operate internationally.\\n       The digital bank landscape has been evolving rapidly in Switzerland, with new local players emerging every year. The market was first created by Kaz, which launched in February 2018, followed by Newy a year later. JaCan was set up in summer 2020, with the particularity of having a “fintech banking license” from the Swiss banking supervisory authority FINMA, rather than teaming up with a mother/partner company. In Q4 2020, HypoSuisse created a digital bank called HS*. This month, MailBank and ReferSuisse launched Yeah!, which included features that are not available on any other Swiss digital banking apps. \\n\\n·\\tDigital features such as mobile payment and mobile wallet: While these do not have the same offering as banks, the offerings from tech giants has enabled rapid growth.\\n       In the context of change, Switzerland’s banking sector may be able to learn by looking to the East to success stories like Siam Commercial Bank (SCB). SCB was established by royal charter on January 20, 1907 as the first Thai bank.  Since then, it has played a leading role in providing the financial services needed in Thailand while recently transitioning to become a leading universal bank that offers a wide range of products and services.   \\n\\nTo achieve this, SCB has undertaken a major multi-year digital transformation with a strong focus on going digital.  SCB redefined its approach to banking, leveraging the power of digital tech and cloud computing.  This is already paying dividends, with a significant surge in transaction - already up 23^%^ - and growth in market share. \\nA key market for SCB was younger people.  SCB identified that the loan origination process was deterring customers from applying for loans, as the process was a traditional paper-based approach that did not address the needs of digital natives. By implementing cloud-based solutions, customers can now apply for loans in a matter of moments, submit documents on line and get a rapid response.  \\nThis type of solution has enabled the bank to both grow market share and to improve operational efficiency, with impact on both top line and bottom line. SCB’s transition offers key insights into how banks can use the power of digital to transform their business. \\n\\nKaz\\nKaz was an offering of Bank Clarity, whose banking license means that deposits up to CHF 100,000 per customer would be guaranteed should the bank fail. It operates exclusively in Switzerland. Kaz’s financials were included in those of Bank Clarity. Its web page is part of the Bank Clarity domain and is available only in French, German and Italian. Kaz communicates mostly about the growth in its customer base - from 20,000 in July 2019 to 40,000 in February 2021. Kaz offers most day-to-day banking services with the exception of eBill (a popular way to pay and automate bills in Switzerland). Payments through Kaz are limited to Swiss francs and euros. Kaz targets young, high potential customers (aged 15 to 30) who are Swiss or resident in Switzerland. As a reinsurance factor for customers, Kaz publicized the possibility of accessing branches for customer care, which drove its ability to migrate customers to Bank Clarity’s fuller set of services when they needed higher-yield products such as mortgages, financial investments and so on. \\nNewy\\nZurich-based start-up Newy started to act as a bank through a partnership with Creditbank Springburg in 2019. The legacy bank hosted the accounts and allowed Newy to benefit from its Swiss banking license and the CHF 100,000 deposit guarantee. Newy does not publish its revenue and EBITDA* figures but frequently shares its Swiss customer base growth: It had 50,000 customers at the end of 2020 and 60,000 by February 2021.Newy is a pure player that clearly targets a young professional audience through its communications. It also has the same Swiss residence requirement as Kaz. Newy shook up the Swiss digital banking market by partnering with different fintechs and presenting commodity services like insurance and retirement plans in an innovative digital way. \\nHS*\\nIn 2020 HypoSuisse decided to enter the mobile-only banking market with CSX, which offered all the usual day-to-day services (payments, accounts, pots, etc.) to Swiss residents. The basic free product offered a debit card, but there was a CHF 2 charge for every ATM withdrawal. HypoSuisse admitted that its primary purpose with CSX was to retain digitally savvy customers and upsell them on other services in a few years, as well as to grow along with its customers. This could be seen as a defensive move - cannibalizing itself before its competitors did. Launched in October 2020, HS* had attracted 10,000 customers by March 2021. \\n24HRS\\nTwo of the most significant competitors in the Swiss marketplace were the foreign digital banks 24HRS and Noevol that operated in several countries and had different value propositions.  Created in 2013 under a different name, the start-up was rebranded 24HRS Bank in 2016 when it obtained its own banking license from BaFin (Germany’s financial supervisory authority), which guaranteed deposits up to €100,000.
